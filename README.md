# hapiness-life-expectancy-analysis
This project was developed with a classmate during my Data Analytics Bootcamp at LeWagon. The main goal was to visualize the ranking of countries across worldwide development indicators and to study the linear relationship between happiness and several human development factors, including life expectancy. 
The datas used for this project are from diverse sources (World Bank Data, World Happiness Report,Kaggle)
We used Google BigQuery for data storage and interaction, and built our final dashboard in Looker Studio.
Unfortunatly do to Google's paywall and the revocation of our datasets access, the final dashboard is currently non-functionnal :( The visualizations relied on live queries to BigQuery(wich are no longer available)
